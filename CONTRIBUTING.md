# Contibuting to Cofoundry

## Feedback

Content management systems are by their nature very broad in scope and need to satisfy a large variation of use-cases.  Often when building a new feature the tricky part isn't so much the programming, it is figuring out how the feature should work, discovering the use-cases it needs to satisfy and working out how we make a feature both user-friendly and developer-friendly.

Your feedback is really important in helping us shape Cofoundry and focus on building the right tools in the best way possible.

- Found a bugs or have feature suggestions? Please [add an issue](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/issues) with as much detail as possible

## Code Contributions and PRs

Cofoundry is developed by a very small team. **We currently do not have the resources to review and accept code contributions or put in place the legal framework that would allow us to integrate contributed code.**

We hope that in time as Cofoundry becomes more popular we will be able to invest in this area and start accepting code contributions.

**Please do not send pull requests.** If you are interested in contributing code do get in touch so we can start to gauge interest and advise on alternative ways to contribute.

## Plugin Development

Cofoundry is highly extensible and has a modular architecture that allows developers to build plugins that seamlessly integrate via a simple NuGet install. 

We use this architecture to create our own plugins, but this area is not yet extensively documented. The current documentation is [here](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/wiki/Creating-a-Plugin).

If you are interested in creating your own plugin, please do get in touch with us and we'll be happy to assist.
