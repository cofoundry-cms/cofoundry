# Cofoundry.SamplesGenerator

A quick and dirty tool to copy the sample projects in this repository into a [Cofoundry.Samples](https://github.com/cofoundry/Cofoundry.Samples) repository clone on a local file system. This makes is easy to update the samples repository using this repository as a source of truth.

## Configuration

Use the `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.local.json` file to customize settings, but you'll probably only ever need to change the `CofoundryVersion` setting when new packages are released.
