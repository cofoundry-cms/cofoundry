A user area is an isolated grouping of user accounts that allows you to build custom areas for your signed up users such as a members or customers. All user areas share the same infrastructure and features, but are partitioned to provide a strong level of isolation. They also benefit from separate configuration profiles, so you can have different roles, security policies and registration requirements.

The Cofoundry admin panel is itself a user area and so you benefit from the same level of security and features we use ourselves such as roles, permissions, password recovery and auditing.
