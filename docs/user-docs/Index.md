Welcome to the Cofoundry developer documentation.

## [Getting Started](getting-started)

If you're new to Cofoundry we'd recommend starting with the [Overview](getting-started/overview) to get an idea of what the CMS can do and how it all fits together.

This sections also contains information on [Sample Projects](getting-started/sample-projects), an [installation guide](getting-started/installing) and information on [publishing and deployment](getting-started/publishing-and-deployment)

## [Content Management](content-management)

Cofoundry is primarily a CMS and this section covers all the content manageable aspects of the platform such as [pages](content-management/pages), [images](content-management/images) and [documents](content-management/documents) as well as our flexible [custom entity](content-management/custom-entities) system.

## [Framework](framework)

The content management features of Cofoundry are built on a base framework of tools that you can use to rapidly build out your application using a structured and modular methodology.

This includes documentation features such as [mail](framework/mail), [roles & permissions](framework/roles-and-permissions) and [background tasks](framework/background-tasks) as well as lower level elements such as our [CQS implementation](framework/data-access/cqs), [data access APIs](framework/data-access) and [auto-update framework](framework/auto-update).

## [User Areas](user-areas)

The Cofoundry *User Area* feature can be used to build a member-only area of your site or to deliver enhanced experiences for your signed-up users. User areas are built on the same underlying framework that powers the admin panel, so you can benefit from the same set of features as well as a pre-built section of the admin panel to manager your users.

## [Admin Panel](admin-panel)

This section contains information on customizing and extending the admin panel.

## [Plugins](plugins)

Cofoundry is built on a modular and extensible base framework that allows you to build and distribute plugins that are easily installed via [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Cofoundry). In this section you'll find a list of [official plugins](plugins/available-plugins) as well as information on [creating](plugins/creating-a-plugin) and [installing](plugins/installing-plugins) plugins
