Cofoundry is a modular framework with a powerful plugin system that allows you to easily swap out or add additional features to a Cofoundry application.

## Finding a plugin

All Cofoundry plugins are NuGet packages and can be found in the  [nuget.org package feed](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Cofoundry).

For a full list of plugins check out the [available plugins docs](available-plugins).

## Installing a plugin

In most cases installing a plugin is as simple as installing a NuGet package. This is because Cofoundry's modular architecture allows plugin authors to hook into the startup process and register themselves automatically.

For some plugins there may be additional configuration required, or there may be a number of different packages available to suit different configurations. In any case it's always best to check the plugin documentation for any additional installation or configuration information.
