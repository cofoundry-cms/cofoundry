/// The execution duration randomizer feature prevents execution completing before a random duration 
/// has elapsed by padding the execution time using <see cref="Task.Delay(int)"/>. This can help mitigate 
/// against time-based enumeration attacks by extending the configured minimum duration beyond 
/// the expected bounds of the completion time. For example, this could be used to mitigate harvesting 
/// of valid usernames from login or forgot password pages by measuring the response times.

/// <see cref="IExecutionDurationRandomizerScope"/> instances during the lifetime of a request. This ensures 
/// that the top-level (primary) scope controls the duration of the overall task execution, while inner or child 
/// scopes cannot close the scope early. Any child scopes may extend the duration if they are configured
/// with a longer duration parameters.
