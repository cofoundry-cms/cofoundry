## Roadmap

For up to date information on what's going into up-coming releases check out our [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/cofoundry-cms/cofoundry/milestones).

### SemVer & 1.0

As per [SemVer](https://semver.org/) our 0.x set of releases are considered early development and breaking changes can happen at any point, however our approach is that patch releases are non-breaking while minor releases can be breaking, but will be documented as such in release notes.

Having been open sourced from an existing product, Cofoundry is already loaded with features. What 0.x releases do give us is the ability to make breaking changes and alter our public API as we receive feedback, without constantly publishing major releases.
